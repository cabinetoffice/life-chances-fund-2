# LCF-Web-App-2.0

This Salesforce VisualForce application enables organisations to apply for funding from the The Life Chances Fund (LCF) - a Â£80 million top-up fund, whose objective is to help those people in society who face the most significant barriers to leading happy and productive lives.

The application presents a number of forms to applicants, and manages complex question branching scenarios, in order to collect the necessary information from applicants to fully access their funding needs.
