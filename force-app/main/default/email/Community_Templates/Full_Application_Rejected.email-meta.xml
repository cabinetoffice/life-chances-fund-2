    <textOnly>Hi {!Application__c.Contact_First_Name__c},

Thank you for taking the interest to submit a full application form for the life chances fund.

Though your project proposal was interesting, we have had some strong applications in this phase. So, unfortunately, we will not be taking forward your application.

All the best on your social venture.

Kind Regards,
Centre for Social Impact Bonds</textOnly>
