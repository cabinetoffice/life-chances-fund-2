    <textOnly>Hi {!Application__c.Contact_First_Name__c},

Thank you for taking the interest to submit an expression of interest form for the life chances fund. 

Though your project proposal was interesting, we have had some strong applications in this phase. So, unfortunately, we will not be taking forward your application. 

All the best with your project.

Kind Regards,
The Life Chances Fund team</textOnly>
