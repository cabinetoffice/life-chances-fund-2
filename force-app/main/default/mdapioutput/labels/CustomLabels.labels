The Life Chances Fund (LCF) is an £80 million top-up fund, whose objective is to help those people in society who face the most significant barriers to leading happy and productive lives. The £80 million has been committed by central government to provide contributions for payment-by-results contracts, managed by socially minded investors. These contracts must be locally commissioned and aim to tackle complex social problems.&lt;br/>
